# Spatial_navigation_attractor_network
Here I implement a discrete time, low number of neuron- version of attractor network model introduced in Ocko et al. Emergent elasticity in the neural code for space.

The animations in this project were created using the Manim library, a community-driven Python framework for creating mathematical animations. For more information on Manim, visit their GitHub repository: [Manim GitHub](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).
